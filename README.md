### Project Overview

GynoCare is an interactive and informative web application designed to assist women in assessing their risk for cervical cancer and provides personalized recommendations. The app is built using Streamlit and leverages a knowledge-based system to evaluate risk factors based on the user's answers to a series of questions. By answering a set of questions about personal health history and lifestyle factors, users can get an estimate of their risk level and tailored guidance on prevention and treatment.

This project was developed as part of the **WID2001 Knowledge Representation and Reasoning** course and was a collaborative effort with experts from the **Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, Universiti Malaya**. Our goal was to provide a user-friendly, easily accessible tool that empowers women to better understand their health risks.

### Key Features

- **Interactive Questionnaire**: A series of questions designed to assess the user's risk for cervical cancer based on their age, HPV status, smoking history, family medical history, and other relevant factors.
- **Personalized Risk Assessment**: After completing the questionnaire, users are given a risk score indicating whether they are at low, moderate, or high risk for cervical cancer.
- **Tailored Recommendations**: The app provides actionable recommendations based on the user's risk level, such as scheduling regular Pap tests, HPV vaccination, lifestyle modifications, and seeking medical consultation for high-risk cases.
- **Collaborative Input**: This project was developed with valuable insights from the **Department of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, Universiti Malaya**, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the health advice and recommendations provided.

### Objectives

- To raise awareness about cervical cancer and educate women on risk factors.
- To develop an easy-to-use, interactive platform that provides reliable health recommendations based on individual responses.
- To apply knowledge representation and reasoning techniques to build a knowledge-based diagnostic tool.
  
### Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive web application.
- **Python**: For implementing the logic behind the questionnaire and risk calculation.
- **HTML/CSS**: For custom styling and enhancing the user interface.
